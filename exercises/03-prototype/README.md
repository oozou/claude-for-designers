# Exercise 3: Build a prototype with Claude Code

Put it all together: use Claude Code to build a real frontend prototype.

## The challenge

Build a simple landing page for a fictional product. Use:
- Claude Code to generate the code
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Git to track your progress
- GitHub to share your work

## Setup

1. Go to [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
2. Connect to GitHub if you haven't already (ask Claude: "Help me connect to GitHub")

## Build it step by step

### Step 1: Create and scaffold the project

Ask Claude:
```
Create a new project called "landing-page-prototype" with a simple HTML file
and Tailwind CSS via CDN. Include a basic page structure.
```

### Step 2: Add a hero section

```
Add a hero section with:
- A large headline: "Build faster with AI"
- A subheadline: "The modern way to create beautiful interfaces"
- A call-to-action button: "Get Started"
- Center everything and use nice typography
```

### Step 3: Add features section

```
Add a features section below the hero with 3 cards:
- "Fast Development" - describe speed benefits
- "Beautiful Design" - describe design benefits
- "Easy Collaboration" - describe team benefits
Use a 3-column grid that stacks on mobile
```

### Step 4: Add a footer

```
Add a simple footer with copyright text and links to Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn
```

### Step 5: Polish it

```
Add some visual polish:
- A subtle gradient background on the hero
- Hover effects on the button and cards
- Nice spacing throughout
```

### Step 6: Commit your work

```
Commit all changes with the message "Complete landing page prototype"
```

### Step 7: View your work

Check the preview pane in Claude Code to see your landing page.

## Bonus challenges

1. **Add dark mode**
   ```
   Add a dark mode toggle in the header that switches the color scheme
   ```

2. **Make it a React app**
   ```
   Convert this to a Vite + React + Tailwind project with proper components
   ```

3. **Add animations**
   ```
   Add fade-in animations when the page loads using CSS or Tailwind
   ```

4. **Create a PR**
   ```
   Create a GitHub repository for this project and push my code
   ```

   Then:
   ```
   Create a pull request with a summary of what I built
   ```

## Evaluation checklist

- [ ] Page looks good on desktop
- [ ] Page looks good on mobile (check the preview at different sizes)
- [ ] Button has a hover state
- [ ] Cards have visual separation
- [ ] Code is committed to Git
- [ ] You understand each step you took

## Stuck?

1. Ask Claude: "I got this error: [paste error]. What does it mean?"
2. Ask Claude: "This doesn't look right. The button should be centered."
3. Ask in **#ai-designers** and mention **@const**

## Done?

Congratulations! You've completed the tutorial. You now know:
- How to use Claude Code to build UIs
- How to work with Tailwind CSS
- How to track changes with Git
- How to push to GitHub and create pull requests

Keep practicing by building more prototypes. The more you build, the faster you'll get.
